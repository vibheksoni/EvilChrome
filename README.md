## ‚ö†Ô∏è Educational Purposes Only

This advanced Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates critical browser security vulnerabilities by implementing a sophisticated Chrome browser manipulation framework. It serves as a research tool for understanding potential attack vectors and developing better browser security measures. **For educational and research purposes only.**

## üéØ Project Overview

EvilChrome exposes potential security flaws in Chrome's architecture through a comprehensive monitoring system that demonstrates:

- Undetectable Chrome instance manipulation
- Real-time session hijacking capabilities
- Form data interception mechanisms
- Cookie theft and manipulation techniques
- Stealth profile access methodologies
- Cross-origin request forgery possibilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

- Undetected Chrome Driver integration
- Multi-threaded event monitoring system
- Domain-specific action triggers
- Cookie and input field tracking
- Alert handling system
- Graceful cleanup and shutdown

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vibheksoni/EvilChrome.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the PoC
python main.py
```

## üîç Key Attack Vectors Demonstrated

- **Profile Manipulation**: Unauthorized access to Chrome user profiles
- **Silent Monitoring**: Undetectable browser activity tracking
- **Data Interception**: Real-time form submission and cookie capture
- **Session Hijacking**: Browser session manipulation techniques
- **Stealth Operation**: Anti-detection mechanisms using undetected-chromedriver

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Implications

This PoC highlights several security concerns:
- Browser profile access vulnerabilities
- Form data exposure risks
- Cookie manipulation possibilities
- Browser activity monitoring potential
